        <p>I am currently a Masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction &amp; Design at UC Irvine. I used to be an auditor for a couple of years right after undergrad, but I have since decided to do a career switch. I have always been interested in web &amp; design!
        <br>
        As a kid, I was an active user on Neopets.com, where I really got into customizing profile layouts and editing templated blogs with html. That was my first experience with "coding," but I am really eager to keep learning more through this class!
        <br><br>
        I'd like to try out some stuff I learned on Codecademy (making a table):</p>
