    <h1>Hello, this is my webpage for my Interactive Tech class!</h1>
    <p>Here is the paragraph text required for the assignment. I've also added some other random stuff below:</p>

    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction &amp; Design at UC Irvine. I used to be an auditor for a couple of years right after undergrad, but I have since decided to do a career switch. I have always been interested in web &amp; design!
      <br>
      As a kid, I was an active user on Neopets.com, where I really got into customizing profile layouts and editing templated blogs with html. That was my first experience with "coding," but I am really eager to keep learning more through this class!
      <br><br>
      I'd like to try out some stuff I learned on Codecademy (making a table):<br></p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <th>Day of the Week</th>
          <th>Planned Activities</th>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
