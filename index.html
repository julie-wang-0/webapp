        <p>I am currently a Masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction &amp; Design at UC Irvine. I used to be an auditor for a couple of years right after undergrad, but I have since decided to do a career switch. I have always been interested in web &amp; design!
        <br>
        As a kid, I was an active user on Neopets.com, where I really got into customizing profile layouts and editing templated blogs with html. That was my first experience with "coding," but I am really eager to keep learning more through this class!
        <br><br>
        I'd like to try out some stuff I learned on Codecademy (making a table):</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <th>Day of the Week</th>
            <th>Planned Activities</th>
          </thead>
          
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Friday, April 19</td>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>Finish 285 assignments</li>
                  <li>Take the Caltrain back home</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Saturday, April 20</td>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>Buy a baked potato at my local farmer's market</li>
                  <li>Buy a cup of Philz Coffee</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Sunday, April 21</td>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>Have tea at a friend's house</li>
                  <li>Get a head start on assignments</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                  <li>Check-in with a client for illustration</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
          
        </table>
