    <h1>Hello, this is my webpage for my Interactive Tech class!</h1>
    <p>I am having a lot of fun learning HTML, but I had some grief with setting up the Github and Heroku connection. Luckily nothing was wrong, I just needed to wait a while for everything to be cleared. I wish Github or Heroku had some better explanatory text on it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction &amp; Design at UC Irvine. I used to be an auditor for a couple of years right after undergrad, but I have since decided to do a career switch. I have always been interested in web &amp; design!
      <br>
      As a kid, I was an active user on Neopets.com, where I really got into customizing profile layouts and editing templated blogs with html. That was my first experience with "coding," but I am really eager to keep learning more through this class!
      <br><br>
      I'd like to try out some stuff I learned on Codecademy (making a table):<br></p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <th>Day of the Week</th>
          <th>Planned Activities</th>
        </thead>
        
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Friday, April 19</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Finish 285 assignments</li>
                <li>Take the Caltrain back home</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Saturday, April 20</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Buy a baked potato at my local farmer's market</li>
                <li>Buy a cup of Philz Coffee</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sunday, April 21</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Have tea at a friend's house</li>
                <li>Get a head start on assignments</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Monday, April 22</td>
            <td>
              <ul>

                <li>Check-in with a client for illustration</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        
      </table>
